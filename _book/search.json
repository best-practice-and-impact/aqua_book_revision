    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nThis version of the AQuA book is a preliminary ALPHA draft. It is still in development, and we are still working to ensure that it meets user needs.\nThe draft currently has no official status. It is a work in progress and is subject to further revision and reconfiguration (possibly substantial change) before it is finalised.\n\n\n\nPreface\nThe last version of the Analytical Quality Assurance (AQuA) Handbook was published in 2015, following Sir Nicholas Macpherson’s Review of quality assurance of government models. Since then, assurance has become part of the fabric of good practice for developing evidence to support policy development, delivery and operational excellence. The AQuA Book has made a significant contribution to the cultural change in assurance practices in government.\nThe AQuA Book is about the process for assuring analytical evidence in all forms. It sets out the core framework for assuring all forms of analytical evidence. It describes what you need to do but not how to do it, aqlthough it does contain many worked examples. Large organisations will have their own processes and practices covering “the how”. For those of you who do not work in places with bespoke guidance you will find a collection of helpful resources in chapter 10.\nThe AQuA Book is a key supporting guide for the Analysis Function Standard. It is referred to by the Green Book, Magenta Book and Finance Function Standards.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe AQuA Book is the work of many authors from across the Government Analysis Function. The original version of the book was compiled by the Quality Assurance Working Group set up after Sir Nicholas Macpherson’s review of modelling in government. This revised edition of the book was produced by a task and finish group drawn from across the Analysis Function community. We would like to thank everybody who has given of their time and expertise to produce this revised edition.",

    "text": "Principles of analytical quality assurance\nNo single piece of guidance provides a definitive assessment of whether a piece of analysis is of sufficient quality for an intended purpose. However, the following principles support commissioning and production of fit-for-purpose analysis:\nProportionate: Quality assurance effort should be appropriate to the risk associated with the intended use of the analysis and the complexity of the analytical approach. These risks include financial, legal, operational and reputational impacts. More details can be found in chapter [3]\nAssurance throughout development: Quality assurance should be considered throughout the life cycle of the analysis and not just at the end. Effective communication is crucial when understanding the problem, designing the analytical approach, conducting the analysis and relaying the outputs. More details on the analysis life cycle can be seen in chapter [5].\nVerification and validation: Analytical quality assurance is more than checking that the analysis is error-free and satisfies its specification (verification). It should also include checks that the analysis is appropriate, i.e. fit for the purpose for which it is being used (validation). Validation and verification are covered in more depth in chapters [5-9].\nAccept that uncertainty is inherent in the inputs and outputs of any piece of analysis. Chapter [8] covers assurance of the analytical phase of the project, including the treatment of uncertainty . Further support can be found in the Uncertainty Toolkit for Analysts in Government (analystsuncertaintytoolkit.github.io)\nAnalysis with RIGOUR: One acronym some users find helpful to consider when completing analysis is RIGOUR. This is described in the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRIGOUR\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout all the stages of an analytical project, the analyst should ask questions of their own analysis. The helpful mnemonic “RIGOUR” may assist:\n\nRepeatable\nIndependent\nGrounded in reality\nObjective\nUncertainty-managed\nRobust\n\nRepeatable: For an analytical process to be considered valid we might reasonably expect that the analysis produces the same outputs for the same inputs and constraints. Different analysts might approach the analytical problem in different ways, while methods might include randomised processes. In such cases, exact matches are not guaranteed or expected. Taking this into account, repeatability means that if an approach is repeated the results should be as expected.\nIndependent: Analysis should be free of prejudice or bias. Care should be taken to balance views appropriately across all stakeholders and experts.\nGrounded in reality: Quality analysis takes the Commissioner and Analyst on a journey as views and perceptions are challenged and connections are made between the analysis and its real consequences. Connecting with reality like this guards against failing to properly grasp the context of the problem that is being analysed.\nObjective: Effective engagement and suitable challenge reduce the risk of bias and enables the Commissioner and the Analyst to be clear about the interpretation of results.\nUncertainty-managed: Uncertainty is identified, managed and communicated throughout the analytical process.\nRobust: Analytical results are error free in the context of residual uncertainty and accepted limitations that make sure the analysis is used appropriately.",

Decisions logs should describe each decision and set out when it was made, why it was made, who made it and who signed it off.\n\n\nData log\nA register of data provided by the commissioner or derived by the analysis that have been risked assessed and signed-off by an appropriate governance group or stakeholder.\n\n\nQuality assurance plan\nA detailed plan of what verification and validation activities should be produced identifying the key risk areas within the analysis. This should be thought about throughout the analytical lifecycle, from initial scoping, designing the analysis, to delivering the analysis.

For analysis that is likely to be revisited or updated in the future, documentation should be provided to assist a future analyst and should be more comprehensive. This documentation should include a summary of the analysis including the context to the question being asked, what analytical methods were considered, what analysis was planned and why, what challenges were encountered and how they were overcome and what verification and validation steps were performed. In addition, guidance on what should be considered if the analysis is to be revisited or updated is beneficial.\n\n\nVersion control\nIt is important to ensure that changes that have been made to analysis can be easily seen and quality assured by the analytical assurer, and the latest version of the analysis is being used.
