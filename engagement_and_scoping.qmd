The draft currently has no official status. It is a work in progress and is subject to further revision and reconfiguration (possibly substantial change) before it is finalised.

# Engagement and scoping

## Introduction
The first stage of the analytical cycle is initial customer engagement and scoping identifying what the Commissioner requires and so what is relevant for the analysis.  The Analyst works with the  Commissioner to develop sufficient understanding of the problem to design a requisite analysis.

During engagement and scoping, the Commissioner and the Analyst shape the analysis by developing a shared understanding of the problem and the context. This shared understanding will be used as the basis for designing analysis that suits the Commissionerâ€™s requirements.

### The Commissioner's responsibilities during engagement and scoping

The Commissioner is responsible for ensuring that:

* Key aspects of the problem, scope, and programme constraints, are captured and clearly communicated to the Analyst.    
* They are available to actively engage with the Analyst to appropriately shape the work.    
* There is sufficient governance in place to support the analysis and its role in the wider project or programme. This is particularly important if the analysis supports business critical decisions. This proportionality may need to be revisited at the design stage if a novel or riskier approach is required (for example if AI models are used).    
* They understand risks where time and resource pressures constrain the approach.    
* They request information from the Analyst on accounting for uncertainty, and challenge them when it is absent, inadequate or ambiguous.    
* They Communicate to the Analyst any sources of uncertainty they have identified as part of their wider considerations.    
* If possible, indicate in advance the consequences for decision-making of different degrees of uncertainty, as this may enable the Analyst to conduct their analysis at a proportionate level.    
* The specification document produced by the analyst is signed off.

### The Analyst's responsibilities during engagement and scoping

* The Analyst is responsible for engaging with the Commissioner to identify the question, the context, and the boundaries of the analysis, as well as constraints (e.g. deadlines, available resource), assumptions, risks, and business-criticality. 
* The Analyst should create a specification document which captures the initial engagement with the Commissioner. It should provide a definition of the scope and project constraints. It should state the acceptable level of risk, the required level of assurance and the degree of uncertainty allowed for decision-making.
* The Analyst should share this specification with the customer and seek agreement on the approach.

### The Assurer's responsibilities during engagement and scoping

The Assurer might be required to provide assurance that the engagement process has been sufficient to fully understand the problem, and that the specification document adequately captures the outcomes of the engagement process.

### The Approver's responsibilities during engagement and scoping

The Approver should document the new project and ensure that required mechanisms are in place for the appropriate assurance to take place. For example, they should ensure that the Analyst and Assurer are aware of local assurance protocols. 

## Assurance of the engagement and scoping stage

The engagement and scoping stage provides the Analyst with an understanding of the Commissioner's requirements. In some cases, the Commissioner may present a well-defined problem, while in other instances, the engagement stage may require problem structuring methods. Techniques such as the Strategic Choice Approach, Rich Pictures and Systems Thinking can help the Analyst and Commissioner to reach a joint understanding of the problem (see the [Systems Thinking Toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/systems-thinking-for-civil-servants/toolkit) for further information). Through the engagement, the Analyst and Commissioner will be in a position to define the scope of the project in terms of the context and bounds of the analysis. In cases where the engagement and scoping techniques are complex and/or the project is deemed business critical, the Assurer might provide assurance of the engagement methodology (https://publications.tno.nl/publication/100301/Zs2SUz/wijnmalen-2012-natoclient.pdf)

In addition to understanding the problem, the engagement and scoping stage should lead to agreement between the Analyst and Commissioner around the outputs to be delivered, including acceptable levels of accuracy, precision and margins of error. This will inform the handling of uncertainty and the assurance of thereof in later stages.


The Analyst and Commissioner should also clarify risks and potential impacts of the project which will inform the decisions around [proportionate assurance](proportionality.qmd). Constraints around resource and timelines should also be clarified and agreed.

The output of this phase should be a [specfication document](Add hyperlink) that captures the joint understanding. This document provides a reference for later [validation](#def_validation) assurance activities (i.e. that the analysis meets the specification). This document also provides evidence for the Approver during the [delivery stage](delivery_and_communication.qmd) that the analysis meets the specification. The document should be signed off by the Commissioner, and might be reviewed by the Assurer.

## Multi-use models and the engagement and scoping stage

In the case of multi-use models, the Analyst may be required to engage with a group of end-users to develop an understanding of their respective requirements. As requirements might differ or contradict, techniques such as Strategic Options Development and Analysis ([SODA](https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/938444/soda_-_the_principles.pdf)) and [Soft Systems Methodology]**ADD HYPERLINK** may be used to develop a shared understanding across multiple groups.

## Black-box models and the engagement and scoping stage

Where the Commissioner has engaged with the Analyst to deliver AI/ML models, the engagement and scoping stage should include discussions around ethics and risks in order to assess whether such models would be appropriate for addressing the given problem. For example, discussions might include considerations of regulations such as UK GDPR, organisational skills, and internal governance and risk management.
