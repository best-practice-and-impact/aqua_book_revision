::: {.callout-important}
This version of the AQuA book is a preliminary ALPHA draft.  It is still in development, and we are still working to ensure that it meets user needs. 

The draft currently has no official status. It is a work in progress and is subject to further revision and reconfiguration (possibly substantial change) before it is finalised.

# Definitions and concepts

This chapter sets out definitions and concepts that are used throughout the rest of the book. 

## Analysis {.unnumbered}

Analysis is the collection, manipulation and interpretation of information and data for use in decision-making. Analysis can vary widely between situations and many different types of analysis may be used to form the evidence base that supports the decision-making process.  

Examples of types of analysis that are frequently encountered in government are:  

*  actuarial  
*  data science 
*  economic 
*  financial  
*  geographical 
*  operational research 
*  scientific, technical and engineering research  
*  statistical  
*  social research  

## Assurance {.unnumbered}

Analytical assurance is the process and set of practices that ensure analysis is fit for purpose. 

## Assurance activities {.unnumbered}

Assurance activities are any actions carried out in order to validate and verify analysis. 

This may include:   

* analyst testing    
* peer review  
* reconciliation of results to independent sources  

## Artificial Intelligence {.unnumbered}

Artificial intelligence (AI) attempts to simulate human intelligence using techniques and methods such as machine learning, natural language processing and robotics. AI aims to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making and language understanding. AI models are a subset of [black box models](#black_box_models)


## Black box models {.unnumbered}

The internal workings of black box models are not visible or easily understood. These models take input and produce output without providing clarity about the process used to arrive at the output. [AI](#Artificial Intelligence) models are the most common type of black box models used today. Other forms of black box models may be developed in the future.  


## Business critical analysis {.unnumbered}

Business critical analysis has significant influence over financial and funding decisions, is necessary to the achievement of a departmental business plan, or is analysis where an error could have a significant reputational, economic or legal implications. 

The first edition of the AQuA book described business critical models. This has been updated to the more general term 'business critical analysis' because analysis can be business critical without including a model. Some departments may continue to use the term business critical models (BCM). 

## Documentation {.unnumbered}

### Specification documentation {.unnumbered}

Specifications capture the initial engagements with the commissioner. They describe the question, the context and any boundaries of the analysis. The specifications provide a definition of the scope of the project and a mechanism for agreeing project constraints (for example, deadlines and available resources) and capturing what level of assurance is required by the commissioner.

### Design documentation {.unnumbered}

Design documents describe the analytical plan, including the methodology, inputs and software. They also contain details of the planned [verification](#verification) and [validation](#validation) of the analysis. They provide a basis for the analytical assurer to verify whether the analysis meets the specified requirements.

You can read more about design documentation in the [Design](design.qmd) chapter.

### Assumptions log {.unnumbered}

A register of assumptions, whether provided by the commissioner or derived by the analysis, that have been risk assessed and signed off by an appropriate governance group or stakeholder. Assumption logs should: 

* describe each assumption
* quantify its effect and reliability
* set out when it was made
* explain why it was made
* explain who made the assumption and who signed it off

### Decisions log {.unnumbered}

A register of decisions, whether provided by the commissioner or derived by the analysis. Decisions logs should: 

* describe each decision
* set out when it was made
* explain why it was made
* explain who made the decision and who signed it off

### Data log {.unnumbered}

A register of data provided by the commissioner or derived by the analysis that has been risked assessed and signed-off by an appropriate governance group or stakeholder.  


### User/technical documentation {.unnumbered}

All analysis shall have user-documentation, even if the only user is the analyst leading the analysis. This documentation should include: * 

* a summary of the analysis including the context to the question being asked 
* what analytical methods were considered 
* what analysis was planned and why 
* what challenges were encountered and how they were overcome 
* what verification and validation steps were performed

Where relevant the analyst may include a model map that describes data flows and transformations.

For analysis that is likely to be revisited or updated in the future, more comprehensive documentation should be provided to assist a future analyst. It may also be helpful to include guidance on what should be considered or updated. 

### Assurance statement {.unnumbered}

A brief description of the analytical assurance that have been performed to assure the analysis. The statement should refer to known limitations and conditions associated with the analysis.

# Example of publishing quality assurance tools
The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and Department for Business and Trade (DBT) have published a range of quality assurance tools and guidance to help people with Quality Assurance of analytical models. [Modelling Quality Assurance tools and guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-security-and-net-zero-modelling-quality-assurance-qa-tools-and-guidance) are used across the two departments to ensure analysis meets the standards set out in the AQuA book and provide assurance to users of the analysis that proportionate quality assurance has been completed. 

:::

## Multi-use models {.unnumbered}

Some models, often complex and large, are used by more than one user or group of users for related but differing purposes, these are known as **multi-use models**.  

Often, a Steering Group is created to oversee the analysis of these models. This Steering Group would be chaired by the senior officer in charge of the area that maintains the model and consist of senior representatives of each major user area. The members of the Steering Group would ideally have decision-making responsibilites in their area of work. 

## Quality analysis {.unnumbered}

Quality analysis is fit for the purpose it was commissioned to meet. It should be: 

* accurate 
* appropriately assured
* evidenced
* bproportionate to its effect 
* adequately communicated
* documented 
* accepted by its commissioners

## Roles and responsibilities {.unnumbered}

The AQuA book defines the following roles:

* commissioner
* analyst 
* assurer
* approver

You can read more in the [Roles and Responsibilities](analytical_lifecycle.qmd/#roles_and_responsibilities) section.

## Third party {.unnumbered}
Any individual or group of individuals that is not a member of the same group as the those commissioning analysis. For example, they may be working for a different government department, a different function or an outside company.

## Uncertainty {.unnumbered}

Uncertainties are things that are not known, are in a state of doubt or are things whose effect is difficult to know. They have the potential to have major consequences for a project, programme or piece of analysis meeting its objectives.[^1]

[^1]: https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Good-practice-guide-Managing-uncertainty.pdf

There are different types of uncertainty. A common classification divides uncertainty into known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns. The type of uncertainty will influence the analytical approach and assurance activities required. 

The [Uncertainty Toolkit for Analysts in Government](https://analystsuncertaintytoolkit.github.io/UncertaintyWeb/index.html) is a tool produced by a cross-government group to help assessing and communicating uncertainty.

## Validation <a name="def_validation"></a>{.unnumbered}

Validation ensures the analysis meets the needs of its intended users and the intended use environment.  

You can read more in [Verification and validation for the AQuA book] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verification-and-validation-for-the-aqua-book) by Paul Glover.

## Verification {.unnumbered}

Verification ensures the analysis meets it specified design requirements. 

You can read more in [Verification and validation for the AQuA book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verification-and-validation-for-the-aqua-book) by Paul Glover.

## Version control {.unnumbered}

It is important to ensure that the latest version of the analysis is being used and any changes made can be easily seen and quality assured by the analytical assurer. There are tools and templates that can be used to record any updates and checks made during a project. They can help to provide a log of the changes that have been made including why and when they were made, and who made them.
