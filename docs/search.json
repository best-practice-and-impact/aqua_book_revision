It is still in development, and we are still working to ensure that it meets user needs.\nThe draft currently has no official status. It is a work in progress and is subject to further revision and reconfiguration (possibly substantial change) before it is finalised.\n\n\n\nPreface\nThe last version of the Analytical Quality Assurance (AQuA) Handbook was published in 2015, following Sir Nicholas Macpherson’s Review of quality assurance of government models. Since then, assurance has become part of the fabric of good practice for developing evidence to support policy development, delivery and operational excellence. The AQuA Book has made a significant contribution to the cultural change in assurance practices in government.\nThe AQuA Book is about the process for assuring analytical evidence in all forms. It sets out the core framework for assuring all forms of analytical evidence. It describes what you need to do but not how to do it, aqlthough it does contain many worked examples. Large organisations will have their own processes and practices covering “the how”. For those of you who do not work in places with bespoke guidance you will find a collection of helpful resources in chapter 10.\nThe AQuA Book is a key supporting guide for the Analysis Function Standard. It is referred to by the Green Book, Magenta Book and Finance Function Standards.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe AQuA Book is the work of many authors from across the Government Analysis Function. The original version of the book was compiled by the Quality Assurance Working Group set up after Sir Nicholas Macpherson’s review of modelling in government. This revised edition of the book was produced by a task and finish group drawn from across the Analysis Function community. We would like to thank everybody who has given of their time and expertise to produce this revised edition.",

It provides a definition of the scope and a mechanism for agreeing the project constraints, e.g., deadlines, available resources, and capturing what level of assurance is required by the commissioner.\n\n\nDesign documentation\nThis document outlines the design of the analysis, including conceptual models to illustrate the analytical problem, and forms an important tool for ensuring that the analytical assurer has the confidence that the analyst can deliver quality analysis.\n\n\nAssumptions log\nA register of assumptions whether provided by the commissioner or derived by the analysis that have been risk assessed and signed off by an appropriate governance group or stakeholder. Assumption logs should describe each assumption, quantify its impact and reliability and set out when it was made, why it was made, who made it and who signed it off.\n\n\nDecisions log\nA register of decisions whether provided by the commissioner or derived by the analysis that have been risk assessed and signed off by an appropriate governance group or stakeholder. Decisions logs should describe each decision and set out when it was made, why it was made, who made it and who signed it off.\n\n\nData log\nA register of data provided by the commissioner or derived by the analysis that have been risked assessed and signed-off by an appropriate governance group or stakeholder.\n\n\nQuality assurance plan\nA detailed plan of what verification and validation activities should be produced identifying the key risk areas within the analysis. This should be thought about throughout the analytical lifecycle, from initial scoping, designing the analysis, to delivering the analysis. The areas identified in the plan can also form the basis of a log for those analysts conducting the verification and validation checks. Any additional verification and validation checks that have been performed should be recorded on the quality assurance plan.\n\n\nUser / technical documentation\nAll analysis shall have user-documentation, even if the user is only the analyst leading the analysis. This is to ensure that they have captured sufficient material to assist them if the analysis is revisited in due course. For analysis that is likely to be revisited or updated in the future, documentation should be provided to assist a future analyst and should be more comprehensive. This documentation should include a summary of the analysis including the context to the question being asked, what analytical methods were considered, what analysis was planned and why, what challenges were encountered and how they were overcome and what verification and validation steps were performed. In addition, guidance on what should be considered if the analysis is to be revisited or updated is beneficial.\n\n\nVersion control\nIt is important to ensure that changes that have been made to analysis can be easily seen and quality assured by the analytical assurer, and the latest version of the analysis is being used. Tools and templates can be used to support with evidencing updates and the checks completed throughout a project providing a log of changes that have occurred, why, when, and by whom.\n\n\nAssurance statement\nA brief description of the analytical assurance that have been performed to assure the analysis. The statement should refer to known limitations and conditions associated with the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of publishing quality assurance tools\n\n\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and Department for Business and Trade have published a range of quality assurance tools and guidance to help people with Quality Assurance of analytical models. Modelling Quality Assurance tools and guidance are used across the two departments to ensureanalysis meets the standards set out in the AQuA book and provide assurance to users of the analysis that proportionate quality assurance has been completed.",

    "text": "Principles of analytical quality assurance\nNo single piece of guidance provides a definitive assessment of whether a piece of analysis is of sufficient quality for an intended purpose. However, the following principles support commissioning and production of fit-for-purpose analysis:\nProportionate: Quality assurance effort should be appropriate to the risk associated with the intended use of the analysis and the complexity of the analytical approach. These risks include financial, legal, operational and reputational impacts. More details can be found in chapter [3]\nAssurance throughout development: Quality assurance should be considered throughout the life cycle of the analysis and not just at the end. Effective communication is crucial when understanding the problem, designing the analytical approach, conducting the analysis and relaying the outputs. More details on the analysis life cycle can be seen in chapter [5].\nVerification and validation: Analytical quality assurance is more than checking that the analysis is error-free and satisfies its specification (verification). It should also include checks that the analysis is appropriate, i.e. fit for the purpose for which it is being used (validation). Validation and verification are covered in more depth in chapters [5-9].\nAccept that uncertainty is inherent in the inputs and outputs of any piece of analysis. Chapter [8] covers assurance of the analytical phase of the project, including the treatment of uncertainty . Further support can be found in the Uncertainty Toolkit for Analysts in Government (analystsuncertaintytoolkit.github.io)\nAnalysis with RIGOUR: One acronym some users find helpful to consider when completing analysis is RIGOUR. This is described in the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRIGOUR\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout all the stages of an analytical project, the analyst should ask questions of their own analysis. The helpful mnemonic “RIGOUR” may assist:\n\nRepeatable\nIndependent\nGrounded in reality\nObjective\nUncertainty-managed\nRobust\n\nRepeatable: For an analytical process to be considered valid we might reasonably expect that the analysis produces the same outputs for the same inputs and constraints. Different analysts might approach the analytical problem in different ways, while methods might include randomised processes. In such cases, exact matches are not guaranteed or expected. Taking this into account, repeatability means that if an approach is repeated the results should be as expected.\nIndependent: Analysis should be free of prejudice or bias. Care should be taken to balance views appropriately across all stakeholders and experts.\nGrounded in reality: Quality analysis takes the Commissioner and Analyst on a journey as views and perceptions are challenged and connections are made between the analysis and its real consequences. Connecting with reality like this guards against failing to properly grasp the context of the problem that is being analysed.\nObjective: Effective engagement and suitable challenge reduce the risk of bias and enables the Commissioner and the Analyst to be clear about the interpretation of results.\nUncertainty-managed: Uncertainty is identified, managed and communicated throughout the analytical process.\nRobust: Analytical results are error free in the context of residual uncertainty and accepted limitations that make sure the analysis is used appropriately.",

There is a need to be confident in analysis delivered, but there is no point spending months assuring simple analysis that will inform a decision that will make minimal impact.\nTable 1 provides a list of key factors that should be considered when determining what level of assurance is appropriate.\nFurther detail and considerations may be found on the Analysis Function’s Quality Questions and Red Flags page.\nFigure 1 shows some assurance techniques that might be considered for different levels of analysis complexity and business risk. The key message is the need for more assurance interventions increases with the complexity of, and the business risk associated with analysis.\nThe interventions in Figure 1 must not be viewed in isolation. Some complex and risky analysis that would benefit from an external review will still require the interventions closer to the axes, for example version control and analyst led testing.\nOne way to view assurance interventions would be to consider individual interventions in a layer. An individual intervention will reduce risks in a particular area, but will leave many other risks unmitigated. Adding more interventions (layers) will start to increase coverage and reduce overall risk.\nThe total elimination of risk will never be achievable, and the balance needs to be found that reduces the overall business risk to an acceptable level. The diagram indicates a few practical assurance techniques. In practice there are many different techniques that need to be considered and implemented as appropriate. Refer to the table in chapter 10.\nMany of these interventions are mentioned elsewhere in the AQUA Book, and are not repeated here.",

    "text": "3.2 Structured assessment of business risk and complexity\nTo guide what assurance is needed it is necessary to take a structured approach when reviewing business risks. Business risk should be viewed as the combination of the potential impact of analysis errors, and the likelihood of errors occurring. In situations where the potential business impact is high, it is more important that the likelihood of errors is reduced.\nThis can be visualised by considering the situation as a risk matrix, illustrated in Figure 2. The impact of the analysis will usually be beyond the control of the analyst to change, so there will be few options to move an assessment down the table. However, there will usually be treatments (or mitigations), involving additional assurance measures, that will allow the assessed business risk to move to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikelihood of errors occurring\n\n\n\nImpact of errors occurring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly Unlikely\n\n\nUnlikely\n\n\nRealistic possibility\n\n\nLikely or probably\n\n\nHighly likely\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHigh\n\n\nHigh\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSevere\n\n\nLow\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHigh\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor\n\n\nLow\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerate\n\n\nVery Low\n\n\nLow\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinor\n\n\nVery Low\n\n\nVery Low\n\n\nLow\n\n\nLow\n\n\nMedium\n\n\n\nTable X shows appropriate responses to a risk assessment. Where business risk is high, appropriate treatment(s) must be considered to reduce the probability of errors occurring. The choice of treatment will depend on the mitigations already in place and on the complexity of the analysis (see Figure 1). For a situation where simple analysis is being employed, a review by an appropriate expert may be sufficient as the additional mitigation. However, for complex analysis that is already employing a wide range internal assurance measures, options like external peer review may be necessary. For situations where the business risk is ‘very low’, there would be very little benefit in applying further assurance mitigations, . Aalthough to avoid the risk growing it remains important to ensure existing or planned mitigations aren’t lost.\nIn cases where there is a need for analysis, but there are also significant time and/or resource constraints, it may not be possible to do as much assurance as usual. In these situations, the focus should be on areas of greatest risk. These risks and limitations must also be communicated, along with appropriate caveats.\n\nTable X - Responses to risk assessment levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessed risk\nMitigations to consider\n\n\n\n\nHigh - Red\nThe risk should not be tolerated.

    "text": "4.1 Leadership\nA quality assurance culture starts with senior leaders. They are accountable for the quality of analysis carried out in their departments. A key element of discharging this accountability is to clearly set out the priority of quality within their teams and create processes for embedding quality assurance.\nSenior leaders should ensure there is clear messaging and standards on quality assurance, through guidance, training, and regular updates. Senior leaders can demonstrate the importance of quality assurance through long term initiatives, like setting up and embedding quality assurance processes within the team and creating roles and teams to support quality assurance. Senior leaders should also regularly talk about quality with their teams and highlight quality successes.\nAs part of a strong quality assurance culture, senior leaders should empower all those in the analytical process to identify any risks to the quality of the work, ensure people at any level can raise any quality concerns, and be able to discuss and constructively challenge each other if they feel those standards are not being met. To underpin this, senior leaders should ensure teams have a common understanding of the quality standards required for their work.\nCreating transparency at all levels can help embed a culture of quality assurance. This includes peer review, open source of code (where possible), external publication of models or methods and publication of the register of Business Critical Models.\nSenior leaders should also develop processes so teams can report when things go wrong, be open and honest when issues occur, carry out reviews to understand the failures in the assurance process and share the lessons learnt across the analytical community.",

    "text": "5.1 Governance and control\nGovernance supports a strong quality assurance culture, by overseeing the management and assurance of analysis. The analysis functional standard sets out the requirements for a governance framework for analysis. Each organisation should have a defined and established approach to assurance, which should be applied proportionately to the risk and value of the activity and integrated with the organisation’s overall assurance framework. \nA governance process should include a well understood chain of responsibility and accountability. For example, the analyst producing the analysis is expected to review their own analysis and may also be required to check other people’s analysis. Senior analysts and managers are expected to provide assurance through peer review or acting as an Analytical Assurer or Approver of the analysis and requirements. Commissioners of the analysis should ask questions about quality and ensure it is fit for purpose and understand uncertainties around the analysis. Therefore, everyone involved in the analytical process has responsibility for Quality Assurance activities. These roles are further described in Chapter 2. \nProject level governance can provide oversight over a particular model or work area, allowing the Approver to ensure the analysis is fit for purpose. For example, formally agreeing assumptions will reduce the need for reworking the analysis providing more time for assurance. These groups help to instil the quality assurance culture by providing clear routes and processes where the quality of analysis can be tested and signed off. Projects governance can also fit within wider programme level governance. \nAnalytical governance boards for new, high-profile or complex pieces of analysis, can allow senior analytical leaders and experts to provide oversight and challenge of analysis and ensure best practice is followed. These groups are often cross cutting in nature, covering a range of analytical approaches and work areas. This can help ensure that innovations and new approaches are disseminated across teams, and standards are applied equally across similar work. \nWhen commissioning analysis externally, either qualitative or quantitative research, or the production of models, then the accountability for the quality sits with the commissioning department. It is the commissioning analyst’s role to ensure that quality standards are clear and being met and documented to the commissioning departments requirements. Further information can be found in the commissioning chapter.\nFor Arm’s Length Bodies (ALBs) the Accounting Officer is accountable for ensuring the requirements set out in the AQuA Book are met.\nUser groups for types of analysis can also provide assurance by setting standards and ensuring projects follow topic specific or specialised guidance, such as coding best practice.",
