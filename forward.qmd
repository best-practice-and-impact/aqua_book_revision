# Forward {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important}
This version of the AQuA book is a preliminary ALPHA draft.  It is still in development, and we are still working to ensure that it meets user needs. 

The draft currently has no official status. It is a work in progress and is subject to further revision and reconfiguration (possibly substantial change) before it is finalised.

This guidance uses the following terms to indicate whether recommendations are mandatory or advisory.  

The terms are:  

* **‘shall’** denotes a requirement, which applies in all circumstances, at all times 
* **‘should’** denotes a recommendation, to be met on a ‘comply or explain’ basis 
* **‘may’** denotes approval 
* **‘might’** denotes a possibility 
* **‘can’** denotes both capability and possibility 
* **is/are** is used for a description 

These are the same terms as those in the [UK Government functional standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards).
